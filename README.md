# shelves
My version of Goodreads using a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
* Users can register, login, and logout of their account
* Logged in users can see a list of which books they have read
* Logged in users can rate and review books and these reviews are stored in a MongoDB database
* Logged in users can see what books other users have read
* Users can sort books into 'bookshelves' (similar to goodreads)
* Users can share their bookshelves with other users
* Added images and descriptions of bookshelves as object features
